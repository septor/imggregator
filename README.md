# Imggregator

An image aggregator!

It's like an image gallery, only you don't upload images and you don't have to create categories!

Still following? No? It's fine, let's go over what it will do:

* Pull images from third-party image hosting sites, like Instagram, Flickr, or Imgur.
* Allow you to display these images on a gallery like page.
* A menu item will be provided so you can display a single image, with various options on retrieval.
* The shortcodes and template system will be used so you can make your gallery page as customized as you wish.

Stick around for more information!
